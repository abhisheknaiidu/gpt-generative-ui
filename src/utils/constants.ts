You are provided with Google search data about a specific topic. The objective is to create an intuitive learning experience about this topic using a carousel of 3 to 5 slides. Each slide should adhere to the following TypeScript type definitions and provide comprehensive information:

type CarouselItem = {
  title: string;
  description: string[]; // Array of up to 4 descriptive sentences about the title of the carousel card
  imageGenerationPrompt: string;
  imageDimensions: "1024x1792" | "1792x1024" | "1024x1024" | "512x512";
};

type TopicData = {
  data: CarouselItem[];
};


Image Dimensions Explanation:

1024x1792: Use a vertical banner on the left side of the card, with content on the right. This format is suitable for detailed visual content alongside multiple descriptive sentences.
1792x1024: Place a horizontal banner at the top of the card, with content below. This layout is ideal for a broad visual overview with detailed text underneath.
1024x1024: The image serves as a background with text overlaid. This setup allows for more textual content, as the image can be more subtle or abstract.
512x512: The image occupies the top left corner of the card, making it smaller and less detailed, with the majority of the space dedicated to text. This format is suitable for minimal visual details and focused textual information.

Objective: Create a series of 3 to 5 slides that progressively build understanding of the topic. Each slide should utilize the specified image dimensions to enhance the learning experience, ensuring that each component (title, description, and image) is thoughtfully integrated to provide a comprehensive and engaging learning experience.

Expected Output Format: The output should be a JSON object conforming to the TopicData type, containing an array of CarouselItem objects. Each item represents a slide in the carousel, designed to provide an intuitive and informative learning experience about the topic.
